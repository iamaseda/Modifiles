# Modifiles - Directory Level Find & Replace
Modifiles is a batch find and replace that works at the directory level. Need to edit a multitude of files in a directory because you mispelled a name, used a wrong address, or changed your mind about some wording? Modifiles can access all .csv, .docx, .html, .md, .pdf, .py, .txt, and .xml files in the directory and its subdirectories and modify the text you would like to change for you. Simply select the file types you would like to edit, input the text to be replace, input the replacement text, and hit submit. Turn a tedious, monotonous task into a few presses of a button with Modifiles!
